#Task : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

pclass: This is a measure of socio-economic status (SES):

1st = Upper class

2nd = Middle class

3rd = Lower class

age: Age is shown as a fraction if under 1 year old. If the age is an estimate, it is given as xx.5.

sibsp: This dataset describes family relationships as follows:

Sibling: Brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister Spouse: Husband or wife (excluding mistresses and fianc√©s) parch: This dataset describes family relationships as follows:

Parent: Mother or father Child: Daughter, son, stepdaughter, or stepson. Note that some children traveled only with a nanny, so for them, parch=0.
